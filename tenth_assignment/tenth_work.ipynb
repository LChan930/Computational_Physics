    "**6.3** Set up a wavepacket that doesn't split up into two pieces (as we observed with our Gaussian packet in Figure 6.2), but moves uniformly in one direction. *Hint:* In the simulations discussed so far in this section we have assumed that the string is at rest prior to $t=0$. In order to construct a single wavepacket that does not immediately split you will have to properly specify both the initial displacement and velocity of the string."

    "**6。9** Perform a spectrum analysis of waves on a string in which one end is free to move while the other is held fixed. Assume an initial Gaussian wavepacket located 40 percent from one end. Explain the peaks in the spectrum in terms of the allowed standing waves. Note that because the ends are free, these standing waves will be different from those found with fixed ends (Figure 6.8)."
